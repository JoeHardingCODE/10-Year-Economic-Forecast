These are the corresponding forecasting code as per my Bridgewater economic forecasting competition entry. The code includes:
1) an ARIMA forecast, for the GDP of China and the US, which may be altered for any country. Just change the WDI identifier for your relevant counties, the graph scale should adjust automatically and (2) a log scaling version
3) a Monte Carlo simulation for world trade volume with an incremental shock probability contingent on the previous state
4) a construction of the flow-style diagram
5) a polynomial smoothed curve of the US-China trade as a index of trade within those two economies and two other codes. These being US/China-Rest of the world trade.
